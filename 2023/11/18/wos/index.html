    <p>I started using Discord in 2020 due to a certain web game that I used to play. The app is quite of a nice thing (if you use the right way and for the right things) to connect with people of specific interest (not just games). One thing that really makes Discord spot out frm other apps is the usage of these softwares called Bots. Appareantly these softwares ease the use of Discord Members and some of them also act as simple games, more of an indie game so to say. I tried doing one myself back in 2020 but with little to no programming knowledge, I miserably failed. This time, I paired with a friend of mine to make this cool discord bot.</p>
<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../../../../images/wos.png" alt="A picture of an Arch Linux Rice" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 25px;">
  <figcaption>One of my bot commands.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Basically, a bot interacts by "reading" what the users send. The way that the bot differs normal messages from commands, (the messages that are to be executed by the bot) is that the commands have a certain prefix. Before some years the prefix was customizable, but now Discord made a universal prefix for all bots which the "/" (slash). This got quite people mad though(me too), however everyone had to implement their bots this prefix, liking it or not, because the bots wouldn't get verified anymore by discord. This is an overall look of Discord Bots.</p>

<p>Based on its commands, a bot can be a moderation bot where you can kick a user from your server, you can mute him and so on, so forth. It can be an utility bot, where you can count invites of people, check your member growth etc. It can also be a game bot! Here it depends on the game, it can be like Dank Memer (an economy bot) where your aim is to get as much coins as you can by working, selling things, betting etc. Or a game bot like mine (warfare bot) which to be honest, is the only one of its kind :)</p>

<p>With WoS (will of steel) you can recruit big armies of troops, fight friends, make alliances with them, wage wars, take part in events and NPCs, loot gold and rubies, buy skins for your medieval castles and so much moooooooooore. </p>

<p>Discord Bot Maret (I will call it like that) lacks a bot of this type. Which is why, I think, our bot got everified within a relative short amount of time (2-3 months). Right now , as I write, we count 83 servers and our first 100 players.</p>

<p>We are now wanting nothing more then hit our first 100 servers mark. We keep voting for our own bot XD to rank it higher so people will add it. In case that you, random stranger, stumble upon this website article then you have to take a look at the bot ;)</p>

<p>You can check its website on
<a href="https://willofsteel.vercel.app">its official Website</a> 
and you can vote for our bot

and

. Thank you very much. Mwah.
